       "[\"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese Red : This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Gris : Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Michigan : Riesling : Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo-Merlot : Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Frappato : Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Alsace : Gewürztraminer : This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Rheinhessen : Gewürztraminer : Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Alsace : Pinot Gris : This has great depth of flavor with its fresh apple and pear fruits and touch of spice. It's off dry while balanced with acidity and a crisp texture. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Alsace : Gewürztraminer : This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Nerello Mascalese : This is dominated by oak and oak-driven aromas that include roasted coffee bean, espresso, coconut and vanilla that carry over to the palate, together with plum and chocolate. Astringent, drying tannins give it a rather abrupt finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Mosel : Riesling : Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling. Off dry on the palate, yet racy and lean, it's a refreshing, easy quaffer with wide appeal.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Other : Malbec : Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo Blend : Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino. Flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Virginia : Meritage : Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Virginia : Red Blend : Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : Delicate aromas recall white flower and citrus. The palate offers passion fruit, lime and white peach with a hint of mineral alongside bright acidity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Merlot : This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Nero d'Avola : Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. Firm but drying tannins provide the framework.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : Pretty aromas of yellow flower and stone fruit lead the nose. The bright palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and delicate notes of lightly toasted oak alongside crisp acidity.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Nero d'Avola : Aromas recall ripe dark berry, toast and a whiff of cake spice. The soft, informal palate offers sour cherry, vanilla and a hint of espresso alongside round tannins. Drink soon.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Red Blend : Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chenin Blanc : Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : Red cherry fruit comes laced with light tannins, giving this bright wine an open, juicy character.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Red Blend : Merlot and Nero d'Avola form the base for this easy red wine that would pair with fettuccine and meat sauce or pork roast. The quality of the fruit is clean, bright and sharp.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : Part of the extended Calanìca series, this Grillo-Viognier blend shows aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine, backed by touches of cut grass and wild sage. In the mouth, it shows ripe yellow-fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Red Blend : Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : This shows a tart, green gooseberry flavor that is similar to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Other notes include tropical fruit, orange and honey. Unoaked, with a splash of Muscat, this has commendable dryness and acidity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Viognier-Chardonnay : White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime. The 80% Viognier component is typical of the warm climate: plump and oily, with a short finish. Chardonnay fills out the blend.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Cabernet Sauvignon : This concentrated Cabernet offers aromas of cured meat, dried fruit and rosemary. Barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce flavors give the wine a bold, chewy feel.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Primitivo : Inky in color, this wine has plump aromas of ripe fruit, blackberry jam and rum cake. On the palate, it is soft and smooth.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Nero d'Avola : Part of the natural wine movement, this wine is made from organic grapes, and the label is printed with vegetable ink on recycled paper. The quality of fruit is very nice, with a juicy palate and a bright berry flavor on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Catarratto : Catarratto is one of Sicily's most widely farmed white grape varieties. This expression shows a mineral note, backed by citrus and almond blossom touches.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : This is a festive wine, with soft, ripe fruit and acidity, plus a red berry flavor.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Maule Valley : Merlot : A berry aroma comes with cola and herb notes. The palate is tangy and racy, and it delivers raspberry and plum flavors, with a modest finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Virginia : Red Blend : Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. An eccentric blend of 50% Tannat, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Pinotage.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Inzolia : Spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. It offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Riesling : This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Virginia : Sauvignon Blanc : This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest. The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : Soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. It has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Red Blend : This blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah opens with savory aromas of cured meat, dried berry, cassis, tobacco and wet earth. There's a touch of almond bitterness on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Petit Verdot : This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit, with a raw feel.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Monica : The Monica grape often shows a rustic or raw quality, with aromas of cherry cola, black pepper and sour fruit. This expression does just that, with an added touch of bright acidity on the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style White Blend : Fruity and lightly herbaceous, this has fine textured acidity along with a pink grapefruit flavor. The wine is bright and easy, and it will be ready to drink in a few months.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Red Blend : A blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese, this delivers forest berry and cola, with blue flower and dusty mineral accents. The palate is easy, bright and lean.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Grillo : There's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this Grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart. The mouthfeel is crisp and simple.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Maipo Valley : Pinot Noir : Lightly herbal strawberry and raspberry aromas are authentic and fresh. On the palate, this is light and juicy, with snappy, lean flavors of red fruit and dry spice. The finish is dry and oaky.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Malbec : Aromas of cranberry, barrel spice and herb are followed by tart cranberry flavors with grainy tannins. It falls a bit flat and the variety seems hard to discern.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Sangiovese : This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Cabernet Franc : The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice and cherry. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, with lightly gritty tannins backing them up. Best suited to the dinner table.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : This fat, yeasty Champagne is comprised predominantly of Pinot Noir. It has ripe red berry fruit, light acidity and a soft, creamy aftertaste. It's ready to drink.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : There are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. The structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : This soft, rounded wine is ripe with generous pear and melon flavors. It's easy and ready to drink young for its smooth, attractively ripe character.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Red Blend : Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : This cooperative, based in Aÿ, has benefited from the fine Pinot Noir in the village to produce a ripe red fruited wine. With balanced acidity and a soft aftertaste, it is ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Chardonnay : Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Aglianico : Aromas of black-skinned fruit, leather, underbrush, game and a briny note all carry over to the lean, somewhat disjointed palate along with suggestions of licorice and raw red cherry. Grainy tannins leave a drying finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Rheinhessen : Riesling : Earthy pollen and mineral notes lend a savory tone to this medium-sweet Riesling. It's soft and slightly pulpy, intensified by overripe tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Drink now through 2018.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Chardonnay : This medium-bodied Chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Touriga Nacional : Grown on the sandy soil of Tejo, the wine is typically soft and open. It is very accessible—with black fruits and light tannins for this grape. It is ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Rapel Valley : Carmenère : Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Galicia : Albariño : Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albariño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : France Other : Petit Manseng : This fruity, sweet wine is immediately attractive and ripe. With its great apricot and pineapple fruit, hints of spicy wood and balancing acidity, it's perfect as an apéritif—light and refreshing. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : South Australia : Rosé : Pale copper in hue, this wine exudes passion fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers nuances of muskmelon as well. It's crisp, racy and medium in body, perfectly suited to summertime refreshment. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : A healthy addition of 13% Petite Sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Germany : Rheinhessen : Riesling : Pronounced dust, pollen and earth tones lend savoriness to this otherwise citrusy wine. Racy acidity and fresh tangerine and lemon flavors turn herbal on the finish. Drink now.',\n",

       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant.

       " \"wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer.

Imported by Acadia Imports.\",\n",

Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Barbera : A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar.

       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties.

The wine is named to celebrate the second Lança generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents.

       " \"wine review : Germany : Mosel : Riesling : Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here.

       " 'wine review : Portugal : Alentejano : Portuguese Red : From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine.

Drink 2018–2034.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature.

The ornate label dates back to 1926.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Aconcagua Valley : Red Blend : This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Franc : The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese Grosso : Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Other : Torrontés : With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Carmenère : Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Red Blend : This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Merlot : Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Casablanca Valley : Chardonnay : Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Red Blend : Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : South Australia : Cabernet Sauvignon : From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate.

       " \"wine review : Italy : Veneto : Red Blend : Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.',\n",

       " 'wine review : Portugal : Alentejo : Portuguese Red : A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : G-S-M : This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rhône varieties.

The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape.

Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Rhône Valley : Rhône-style Red Blend : This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Verdejo : Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so.

For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Red Blend : This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Rhône-style Red Blend : This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Israel : Galilee : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese : Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Portugal : Beira Atlantico : Portuguese Red : Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Fumé Blanc : Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Hungary : Tokaj : Furmint : From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : Pinot Bianco : This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese : Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : Pinot Bianco : Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : South Africa : Stellenbosch : Chardonnay : There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : South Africa : Stellenbosch : Chenin Blanc : This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : New York : Pinot Noir : The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : New York : Riesling : A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Red Blend : Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : New York : Gewürztraminer : Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Bonarda : Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Shiraz : Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Montepulciano : Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Syrah : Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Moscato : The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Grenache : The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Southwest France : Ugni Blanc-Colombard : Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Sangiovese : Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.',\n",

       " 'wine review : US : New York : Chardonnay : This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Red Blend : Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Other : Chardonnay : Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Sauvignon Blanc : Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Merlot : Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Virginia : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.\",\n",

Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.',\n",
       " \"wine review : South Africa : Coastal Region : Red Blend : This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry.

       " 'wine review : South Africa : Stellenbosch : Cabernet Sauvignon : This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla.

       " 'wine review : France : Southwest France : Malbec : Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2–3 years, the wine will always be firm.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Red Blend : A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas.

       " 'wine review : Chile : Colchagua Costa : Pinot Noir : Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Languedoc-Roussillon : Rosé : An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish.\",\n",

       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Rheinhessen : Scheurebe : A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe—one of Germany's lesser-known grapes.

The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling.

       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Sparkling Blend : One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging.

The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through.

       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.',\n",

       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose.

       " \"wine review : Mexico : Valle de Guadalupe : Sauvignon Blanc : Sauvignon Blanc is, in general, one of Baja's more consistent performers.

A mild bitterness can be found on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : There's plenty of ripe berry-cherry fruit, fine acids and big tannins on this Cab, but it just doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul.

This finishes crisp, with punchy acidity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Red Blend : Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky.

This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Grenache : It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it.

       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Viognier : Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs.

       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Grüner Veltliner : Grüner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink.\",\n",

       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Veneto : Glera : This bubbly Prosecco Superiore offers vibrant tones of white flower and cut grass followed by light touches of peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft with a subtle touch of sweetness.',\n",

       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : An easy Pinot Noir, but by no means lacking elegance. It shows the moderate body and crisp, citrusy acidity that usually marks Edna Valley Pinot Noir, with pure, direct flavors of sour-cherry candy, cola, cinnamon and toast.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Idaho : Red Blend : Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers. The enjoyment here is mainly focused on mouthfeel, which is voluptuous and rich, leading to an open finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Idaho : Red Blend : This unusual blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah comes together nicely, with the Syrah lending notes of cranberry and smoked meat and the Petit(e)s adding some heft to the plush texture and bitterness on the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Idaho : Red Blend : Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Veneto : Garganega : Here's a pure expression of the Garganega grape that sees (in part) 8 months of oak aging for extra density and thickness. The wine shows spicy notes of cinnamon and white pepper backed by peach and candied fruit.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Veneto : Garganega : Made with the indigenous Garganega grape (the same variety that makes Soave), this richly extracted white wine opens with an off-gold color and ripe notes of apricot and peach nectar.',\n",

       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Shiraz : This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential. Drink now-2030.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Gewürztraminer : Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Riesling : Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : Victoria : Viognier : This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruit—tangerine, pineapple and apricot—and gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink now–2020.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Viura : Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Shiraz : The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Alsace : Alsace white blend : A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Riesling : A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Pinot Gris : There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Gris : Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Portugal : Alentejano : Portuguese Red : This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte.

Drink from 2017.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Creamy in texture and floral in aroma, this is a lovely and well-integrated white wine, with well-crafted characteristics of pear and honeyed apple. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table and on its own.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : Boosted by 5% Petit Verdot, this bottling shows lush aromas of fudge, black plum, black currant, soy and black pepper. The palate is dense and thick with more black fruit as well as caramel, purple flowers, milk chocolate and mint-chip ice cream, proving concentrated and decadent.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Pommard and Wädenswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Portuguese Red : As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese Red : This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Germany : Mosel : Riesling : A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : Sauvignon : You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Riesling : Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : Western Australia : Riesling : Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Grenache : Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Riesling : Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : South Africa : Coastal Region : Rhône-style Red Blend : The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.\",\n",

It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo.

Drink 2016–2021.\",\n",

The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Malbec : This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak.

       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy.

Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Tuscany : White Blend : Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Northeastern Italy : Chardonnay : A landmark wine for those who love Italian sparklers, this shows loads of ripe apricot, melon and honey notes, with toasted nut and baked bread hints in the background.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : This is dry, rich, heady, spicy and utterly delicious. As usual, it contains a splash of Petite Sirah. Already throwing some sediment, it's pretty tannic, with complex flavors of wild blackberry and blueberry, black currant, licorice, cola, bacon and plum sauce, with a hint of exotic pepper and spice. This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese Red : This mature wine has a soft, smooth character and ripe fruit. With its red-berry flavors and gentle tannins, it's very ready to drink.

       " 'wine review : Argentina : Other : Red Blend : This is a highly particular, funky blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet. It opens with savory stewy earthy aromas of berry fruits and prune. Due to the 15.5% abv, this feels heavy and clampy, with rooty flavors of baked berry fruits, cola, minty herbs and carob. An oaky spicy toasty finish with heat is the closing act on this fully stuffed Salta blend.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese Red : A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018.',\n",

       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago.

       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential.

       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Red Blend : This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Grenache Blanc : The nose of this wine combines this grape's best attributes: bright, crisp citrus redolent in grapefruit and Key lime, but with a tropical touch of guava and pineapple. The palate is broad and ripe but restrained enough, with plush mango and guava laid against a chalky backbone.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names. It is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a concentrated texture and flavors of over-extraction. That said, the wine will probably develop over time into something serious with a dark, dense aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This is a perfumed wine, with mint flavors as well as blackberry fruits. There is still a dominant structure of tannins and the wood aging that will allow the wine to age well. The fruits give the wine weight while the aftertaste has great swathes of acidity. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit.

Drink this fine wine from 2019.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Syrah : Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : This is a firm wine, balancing some solid tannins with ripe red fruits. Still young, it is packed with fruitiness and with acidity that are centered around a firm core. Drink this stylish wine from 2018.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Washington : Merlot : Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Chardonnay : The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth.',\n",

       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : Victoria : Chardonnay : Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit.

       " 'wine review : Italy : Central Italy : Verdicchio : Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and chopped herb jump out of the glass. The savory palate serves up juicy Bartlett pear, green apple, citrus and a mint note while a hint of white almond adds depth. Very appealing.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Spain : Central Spain : Tempranillo : Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Franken : Silvaner : White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith.

       " \"wine review : US : Washington : Sauvignon Blanc : All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with Sémillon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : New York : Gewürztraminer : While demure on the nose, this light-footed Gewürztraminer is pretty on the palate with delicate lychee and floral notes. Its unusually nervous and shy for it's variety, but refreshingly quaffable.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Chile : Colchagua Valley : Merlot : Earthy, lightly stewed aromas of plum and berry set up a lively but pinched and narrow palate with candied flavors of mixed red berry fruits. Additional red-fruit friendliness rolls onto the finish of this pleasant but basic Merlot.',\n",

       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo Blend : Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Sparkling Blend : Bready aromas feature melon as the main fruit scent. This is chunky in feel, with moderate acidity and cut. Apple, melon and green-herb flavors finish with hints of toast, yeast and generic sweetness.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese : This displays evident oak sensations of sweet vanilla, toast, espresso, milk chocolate and mature black plum alongside drying tannins. There's not much fresh acidity so drink soon before it dries out.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Malbec : Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside. It's a little rustic around the edges once sipped, but pleasantly so. The mouthfeel is soft, the flavors are peppery and the tannins and acidity are built to last.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Merlot : Nothing is out of place in this solid, attractive and well-priced Merlot. It is a straightforward red wine that feels well-balanced, is medium to full-bodied, and has tasty, mellow plum and cherry flavors. Firm tannins mark the clean finish.',\n",

       " 'wine review : France : Southwest France : Chenin Blanc : Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Viognier : A clean, fresh wine, this opens with crisply varietal aromatics of citrus and orange blossom. The flavors follow suit, adding some fresh-cut pineapple as well; then the wine hits a wall and simply pulls up short.',\n",

       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Aromas of a closed cellar blow off in the glass to reveal underbrush, violet, woodland berries and a hint of white pepper that all carry over to the palate.

       " 'wine review : Chile : Loncomilla Valley : Cabernet Sauvignon : Briary, spicy, mildly herbal berry aromas give way to a full, bold, wiry feeling palate with pointed acidity. Herbal, lightly green flavors of tobacco and plum finish crisp.',\n",

       " 'wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Sparkling Blend : Apple and melon aromas are standard and light. A juicy, citrusy feeling palate delivers stone-fruit flavors of peach and nectarine. A mild finish is fresh in flavor and feel.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Sparkling Blend : Generic white-fruit and matchstick aromas are quiet in nature. This is creamy and not assaulting or sugary on the palate. Mango, melon, lychee and citrus flavors finish with lime notes.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Syrah : Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : New York : Riesling : Blossoms and yellow cherries lend a sweet floral flair on the nose of this dry Riesling. It's straightforward in style, but quaffable and refreshing, with flavors of fresh apple and pear that finish crisp and clean.\",\n",

       " \"wine review : France : Beaujolais : Gamay : While the wine has a crisp side, it's also full of red fruits and soft tannins. That makes for a wine that's fragrant, fruity, ready to drink and not likely to age much. Enjoy it now.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Washington : Cabernet Franc : Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Carricante : Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.',\n",

       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Pinot Noir : The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Burgundy : Pinot Noir : With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Burgundy : Pinot Noir : This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels.

       " 'wine review : France : Burgundy : Chardonnay : Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.',\n",
       " \"wine review : France : Burgundy : Pinot Noir : With intense acidity, this wine has both good structure and red currant and raspberry fruits.

       " 'wine review : France : Alsace : Sylvaner : Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate.

       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Fiano : Scents of pressed white flower, orchard fruit, smoke, citrus and a whiff of nut lead the nose on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers mature pear, pineapple, peach and hazelnut while a note of flinty mineral lifts the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Syrah : Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.',\n",

       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : This is a generous, leathery and tannic wine, full-bodied and made in a juicy, foreboding style. Black pepper, leather and cigar smoke provide a sultry, robust edge to the wine, which should cellar well, through 2020.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Franc : Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release.

       " \"wine review : Germany : Ahr : Früburgunder : Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.\",\n",

       " 'wine review : US : California : Merlot : Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.',\n",

       " \"wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Red Blend : Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.\",\n",

       " 'wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Red Blend : This elegant 80-20 Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers mature aromas of ripe berry, black cherry and fresh aromas of dried herbs and powdered licorice. The somewhat subdued bouquet leads to a generous mouthfeel that leaves a long-lasting impression.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Sparkling Blend : Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Petite Sirah : So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment.

       " 'wine review : France : Languedoc-Roussillon : Rhône-style Red Blend : This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese White : Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging.

       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Cabernet Franc : A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : A rich, tasty Pinot, packed with black cherry pie filling, cola, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that finish sweet and long. The texture is satisfying. Drink over the next several years.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Viognier : If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you.

       " \"wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.\",\n",

Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : Australia Other : Shiraz : This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese : Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time.\",\n",

       " \"wine review : US : California : Syrah : Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Washington : Syrah : Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Red Blend : This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Tuscany : Sangiovese : Tuscany's Mazzei family delivers a wonderful Chianti Classico from their Fonterutoli estate that would pair perfectly with grilled meats or oven-roasted pasta. This is a soft, lush wine with bright cherry and spice notes, which drive a long, velvety finish.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Red Blend : It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Douro : Portuguese White : A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3–4 years.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Texas : Roussanne : White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose. The palate follows suit, remaining quiet and delicate in flavor concentration, yet loud in weight and texture. Salty citrus lingers on the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Germany : Nahe : Riesling : Whiffs of smoke and nuts mingle into tart tangerine and lime flavors in this refreshing off-dry Riesling. Juicy and fresh, it's a straightforward, revitalizing sip. Drink now through 2018.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose. The simple palate isn't very expressive, showing sour red cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Texas : Nero d'Avola : An enticing mix of dark berries and fatty, cured sausage makes for an interesting nose. There's good structure and balance on the palate with this southern Italian transplant. It's juicy, ripe and ready for barbecue.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Texas : Roussanne : Peach, canned tropical fruit and white flower aromas are pristine on the nose.

       " 'wine review : Portugal : Vinho Verde : Avesso : A fresh lemon-flavored wine with crisp acidity balanced by warmer white-stone fruit. It is fruity, showing a touch of toast and almonds. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : The nose isn't very expressive, offering aromas of toasted hazelnut, while the dense, simple palate shows dried black cherry and licorice. It's shy on freshness and has round but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : This opens with aromas of toast, oak, menthol, resin, coffee bean and medicinal notes. The aromas carry over to the firm palate, along with thyme, clove, licorice and bracing tannins.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : France Other : Cinsault : Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla. The palate is plush and fruit-forward, with ample acidity and medium tannins that lend pleasant structure. Accents of sweet spice grace the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Rosé : This light, refreshing rosé mixes fresh strawberry fruit with apple-flavored acids. It's finished bone dry, with an almost dusty mouthfeel (in a good kind of way).\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Other : Malbec : Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Gris : Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : This has aromas suggesting grilled herb, toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of wet animal fur. The palate offers dried cherry, game, anisette and a green note of bitter sage alongside extremely astringent tannins.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Pinot Gris : Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : Australia Other : Sauvignon Blanc : Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Portuguese White : A blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is totally crisp and refreshingly fruity. It is perfumed, smooth while also cut with acidity. The acidity comes from both citrus and pineapple flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Sauvignon Blanc : Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Tejo : Tinta Miúda : Known in Spain as Graciano, this grape produces attractive, fruity wine especially in the Tejo region. This example is ripe with layers of acidity as well as a generous texture. Soft and smooth, it is ready to drink.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : South Australia : Sauvignon Blanc : This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains : An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Vinho Verde : Portuguese Sparkling : This is crisp and fresh medium-sweet wine. It is bright with red-currant acidity and ripe with a strawberry and cream flavor. The wine is clean, lively and, of course, ready to drink.',\n",

       " 'wine review : US : California : Zinfandel : This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Malbec : Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits. Tannins in the back give enough shape, although it will be ready to drink from early 2017.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character. The red-berry fruits and acidity are there, promising a fresh wine from 2018.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging. It has spice, a smoky character and attractive finishing freshness. Drink from 2017 when the wine will be fully balanced.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : From a estate in the Marmet family since 1990, the wine has ripe Merlot flavors that give a generous character. Big, bold fruitiness dominates this wine whose structure is firm while smooth. Drink starting from 2019.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Chardonnay : This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Blanc : This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo : Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : Neatly divided between the three major grapes of Champagne, this full, ripe wine is packed with rich apple and pear fruits. It is crisp while showing a high dosage giving a softer, smoother aftertaste. Drink this bottling now.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Levante : Monastrell : Cool aromas of cola, leather and black cherry set up a fairly full but fresh palate with moderate creamy weight. This tastes reedy and spicy, with wild-berry fruit, peppery notes and a distinct flavor of creamy oak. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Pinot Noir : Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo Blend : Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Viognier : Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe. Melon and vanilla appear on the nose and palate, with a side tone of pineapple, nutmeg and even clove, finishing clean and with simplicity.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Sangiovese : Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels. The oak is integrated within this otherwise leathery, tannic and mild-mannered wine, ripe in cherry and cassis.',\n",

       " 'wine review : Portugal : Alentejano : Portuguese Red : It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine. Concentrate and rich, the generous berry flavors are balanced by a more restrained acidity and smoky flavors. The wine is ready to drink.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : Fragrant and fresh, this easy-drinking red has alluring scents of woodland berry, violet and a whiff of freshly tilled soil. The taut, luminous palate offers sour cherry and star anise accompanied by polished tannins and racy acidity.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Chardonnay : With a richness to the nose, this wine possesses a medium-sized body and moderate acidity, showcasing ripe apple, pear and tropical elements. The finish is focused in simple notions of preserved lemon and pineapple.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Petit Verdot : This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Catalonia : Xarel-lo : Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Noir : This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.\",\n",

       " \"wine review : Italy : Piedmont : Nebbiolo : This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper.

       " \"wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Greco : Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Sauvignon Blanc : The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Rosé : Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Bordeaux-style Red Blend : From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Lombardy : Trebbiano : Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Southern Italy : Primitivo : Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.',\n",
       " \"wine review : New Zealand : Marlborough : Sauvignon Blanc : The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.

       " 'wine review : Chile : Casablanca Valley : Chardonnay : Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity.

       " 'wine review : Italy : Veneto : Rosé : Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella—three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy—make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosé. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Chile : Maipo Valley : Carmenère : Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Cabernet Sauvignon : A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Champagne : Champagne Blend : Although it is labeled “Extra Dry” (that is sweeter than Brut), this lively Champagne in its festive little pink bottle is very fresh, with delicious acidity. It finishes lightly, easily.',\n",
       " 'wine review : US : California : Viognier : Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.',\n",

In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Bordeaux : Sauvignon Blanc : This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.',\n",

       " 'wine review : US : California : Gewürztraminer : Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Romania : Dealu Mare : Red Blend : An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Argentina : Mendoza Province : Cabernet Sauvignon : Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Portugal : Port : Port : This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Australia : South Australia : Viognier : While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Gris : This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : Spain : Northern Spain : Tempranillo Blend : Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.',\n",

       " 'wine review : France : Southwest France : Red Blend : Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Southwest France : Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay : A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.',\n",
       " 'wine review : France : Loire Valley : Sauvignon Blanc : An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.',\n",
       " 'wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : White Blend : Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.',\n",
       " \"wine review : Italy : Sicily & Sardinia : Syrah : Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : Australia : South Australia : Shiraz : Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now–2014.\",\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Pinot Gris : Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.\",\n",
       " 'wine review : US : Oregon : Riesling : Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.',\n",
       " \"wine review : US : Oregon : Cabernet Sauvignon : Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.\",\n",
